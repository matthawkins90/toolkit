# Toolkit

This is taken almost directly from [a Udemy course](https://udemy.com/course/building-a-module-in-go-golang/) by [Dr. Trevor Sawler](https://github.com/tsawler/toolbox).

A simple example of how to create a reusable Go module with commonly used tools.

The included tools are:

- [ ] Read JSON
- [ ] Write JSON
- [ ] Produce a JSON encoded error response
- [X] Upload a file to a specified directory
- [X] Download a static file
- [X] Get a random string of length n
- [ ] Post JSON to a remote service 
- [X] Create a directory, including all parent directories, if it does not already exist
- [X] Create a URL safe slug from a string
